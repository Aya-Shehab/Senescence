                            <p>Our Story</p>
                            <p>Our story began with a passion for baking and a love for bringing people together through the joy of delicious, homemade treats.

We take pride in crafting both classic favorites and innovative creations, ensuring every bite is a delightful experience.</p>

                            <p>Behind the Name</p>
                            <p>The name Senescene for a bakery likely draws from "Senescence," meaning the process of aging, symbolizing the art of time-honored baking techniques, fermented doughs, and flavors that improve with age. It evokes nostalgia, warmth, and a connection to tradition, suggesting a bakery that values craftsmanship and heritage in its recipes.</p>

                            <br>
                            <p>The name could also hint at the idea that good things take time, much like the slow fermentation of sourdough or the mastery of classic pastries.</p>
